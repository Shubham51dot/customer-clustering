# K Means Clustering
### The algorithm works as follows:
1. First we initialize k points, called means, randomly.
2. We categorize each item to its closest mean and we update the meanâ€™s coordinates, which are the averages of the items categorized in that mean so far.
3. We repeat the process for a given number of iterations and at the end, we have our clusters.
### Here we are dealing with the dataset which is providing parameters like
1. Annual income
2. Spending score(1-100)
### K-Means clustering is used for this data to find the group of people having the similar characteristics and we are using elbow method to find the optimal clusters in the dataset
