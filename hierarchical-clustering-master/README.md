# Hierarchical Clustering
### A Hierarchical clustering method works via grouping data into a tree of clusters. Hierarchical clustering begins by treating every data points as a separate cluster.
### Here we are dealing with the dataset which is providing parameters like
1. Annual income
2. Spending score(1-100)
### Hierarchical clustering is used for this data to find the group of people having the similar characteristics and we are going to use the dendrogram technique to find the optimal number of clusters
